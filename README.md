# MITA Open Blueprint - A BCM & BPT Data Repository

A comprehensive, machine-readable dataset of CMS MITA (Medicaid Information Technology Architecture) Business Process Templates (BPT) and Business Capability Models (BCM) in JSON format.

## Overview

This repository contains all 152 MITA v3.0 documents (May 2014 Update) converted from PDF to structured JSON format:
- **76 BPT files** - Business Process Templates with detailed process steps and workflows
- **76 BCM files** - Business Capability Maturity models with 5-level maturity assessments

The data covers 9 MITA business areas:
- Business Relationship Management
- Care Management
- Contractor Management
- Eligibility and Enrollment Management
- Financial Management
- Operations Management
- Performance Management
- Plan Management
- Provider Management

> **Note**: Member Management is defined in the MITA framework but has no published BCM/BPT documents.

## Quick Start

### Use Data Directly from GitHub (Recommended)

You can fetch JSON files directly from GitHub without cloning the repository:

```python
import json
import urllib.request

# Base URL for raw GitHub content
BASE_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naretakis/medicaid-mita-data/main/data"

# Load a BCM file directly from GitHub
bcm_url = f"{BASE_URL}/bcm/care_management/CM_Establish_Case_BCM_v3.0.json"
with urllib.request.urlopen(bcm_url) as response:
    bcm = json.loads(response.read())

# Access maturity questions
for question in bcm['maturity_model']['capability_questions']:
    print(f"Question: {question['question']}")
    print(f"Level 1: {question['levels']['level_1']}")
```

```javascript
// JavaScript/Node.js example
const BASE_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naretakis/medicaid-mita-data/main/data";

// Load a BPT file directly from GitHub
const bptUrl = `${BASE_URL}/bpt/care_management/CM_Establish_Case_BPT_v3.0.json`;
const response = await fetch(bptUrl);
const bpt = await response.json();

// Access process steps
bpt.process_details.process_steps.forEach(step => {
    console.log(`Step: ${step}`);
});
```

### Browse the Data

All JSON files are organized in the `data/` directory:
```
data/
├── bcm/  - Business Capability Models
│   ├── business_relationship_management/
│   ├── care_management/
│   ├── contractor_management/
│   └── ...
└── bpt/  - Business Process Templates
    ├── business_relationship_management/
    ├── care_management/
    ├── contractor_management/
    └── ...
```

### Clone for Local Development (Optional)

If you prefer to work with local files:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naretakis/medicaid-mita-data.git
cd medicaid-mita-data
```

```python
import json

# Load from local file
with open('data/bcm/care_management/CM_Establish_Case_BCM_v3.0.json') as f:
    bcm = json.load(f)
```

## Use Cases

This dataset enables:

- **Maturity Assessment Tools** - Build applications that help state Medicaid agencies assess their MITA maturity levels
- **Process Documentation** - Generate human-readable process documentation from structured data
- **Workflow Automation** - Map MITA processes to automated workflows in your systems
- **Compliance Tracking** - Track implementation of MITA processes and capabilities
- **Research & Analysis** - Analyze patterns across Medicaid business processes
- **Training Materials** - Create interactive training tools for Medicaid staff
- **System Design** - Use as reference architecture for Medicaid system implementations
