Manual-processing steps may require multiple business days to complete claims edits, audits, or pricing. Suspended claims require lengthy manual resolution.",
          "level_2": "Process timeliness improves through use of automation. Timeliness exceeds legal requirements. Electronic claim processing and Point of Sale (POS) adjudication greatly increase timeliness. The entire claim process completes within 24 hours or less.",

Stakeholders are unable to rely on information for decision-making. It is difficult for reviewers to consistently interpret and apply adjudication business rules manually. Attachment data is unstructured, which increases inconsistency of the review process.",
