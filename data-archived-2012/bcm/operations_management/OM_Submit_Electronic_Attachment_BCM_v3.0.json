          "level_2": "Process timeliness improves through use of automation. Timeliness exceeds legal requirements. SMA may scan paper attachments, reducing the distribution time within SMA. It requires 24 hours or less to receive clinical attachment and associate with correct transaction.",
          "level_3": "Timeliness improves via state and federal collaboration, use of information sharing, standards, and regional Health Information Exchange (HIE). Timeliness exceeds Level 2.",
          "level_4": "Information is available in near real time. Processes that use clinical information result in immediate action, response, and results. SMA has interstate interoperability, which further improves timeliness over Level 3.",
