    "description": "The Process Claim business process receives original or adjusted claim (e.g., institutional, professional, dental, pharmacy, and waiver) information via web or Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transaction, assigns an internal control number, and\n- Determines its submission status, and based on that:\n  o Performs Claims Edits:\n    - Edit a single transaction for valid syntax and format, identifiers and codes, dates, and other information required for the transaction.\n    - Validate business edits, service coverage, Third-Party Liability (TPL), and reference coding.\n  o Performs Claims Audits:\n    - Verify against historical information.\n    - Verify that services requiring authorization have approval, clinical appropriateness, and payment integrity.\n  o Suspends claim that fail edits or audits for return to the provider for corrections, additional information, or internal review according to state defined business rules.\n  o Applies National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) Edits.\n  o Applies Diagnosis Related Group (DRG)/Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC), as appropriate.\n  o Prices Claims:\n    - Calculate state allowed amount.\n    - Calculate paid amount.\n\nNOTE: All fee-for-services claim types will go through most of the business process steps but with different business rules associated with the different claim types. Both Centers for Medicaid & Medicaid Services (CMS) and state policy determine business rules for claims edits, audits, and pricing methodologies. State business rules define whether the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) pays, suspends, flags for information, or denies a claim. State business rules define whether an edit is fatal or non-fatal as well. See Constraints.\n\nNOTE: An adjustment to a claim is on an exception use case to this business process that follows the same process path except it requires a link to the previously submitted processed claim in order to reverse the original claim payment and associate the original and replacement claim in the payment information.\n\nNOTE: This business process is part of a suite including Calculate Spend-down Amount, Submit Electronic Attachment, and Generate Remittance Advice business processes.",

      "Perform Fatal Edits: a. If electronic claim submission, perform ASC X12N edits for valid syntax and format, identifiers and codes, dates, and other information required for the transaction according to the agreed-upon levels 1-7 stated in the Trading Partner Agreement. i. If applicable, alert sent to submitter via ASC X12 TA1 Interchange Acknowledgment, 997 Functional Acknowledgment, 999 Implementation Acknowledgment, and/or the 824 Application Advice transaction(s) per Trading Partner Agreement (TPA). END: Business process stops. b. Validate that claim submission meets filing deadlines based on service dates. c. If applicable, reject claim for electronic or paper claim fatal validation errors and send alert to Generate Remittance Advice business process with error report information. END: Business process stops.",
      "Perform Non-Fatal Edits: a. Determine claim status as initial, adjustment to a processed claim, or a duplicate submission that is already in the adjudication process, but not yet completed and loaded into payment history (using a unique Patient Account Number). i. If applicable, associate the claim adjustment to the original claim submission. b. Validate provider information (e.g., provider taxonomy, National Provider Identification (NPI), enrollment status, approved to bill for this service). c. Validate member information (e.g., Member's eligibility status on the date of service, apply third-party resources to the claim). i. If applicable, alert sent to Manage TPL Recovery business process for third-party insurance. d. Validate member's health benefit covers the service and apply appropriate rules. For example: i. Because adult member benefit package does not cover dental services, deny the claim. ii. Member is in another health plan that is their primary insurance, and the Medicaid covers the same service. Designate the claim for the Coordination of Benefits (COB) and deny the claim. Under a payer-to-payer business model, the primary payer receives the COB claim. e. Validate appropriateness of service codes including correct code set versions, and correct association of services with diagnosis and member demographic and health status. f. If provider submits service authorization, referral or treatment plan number, verify the number, member, provider, service, and date(s) of service. g. If state-defined business rules identify certain edits that cause a claim to suspend, and a claim fails for one or more of them, go to Alternate Path: Suspended Claim below.",
      "Perform Audits: a. Check payment history for duplicate processed claim using search key information such as in-house claim number, date of service, provider and member demographics, service, and diagnosis codes. b. If provider did not submit service authorization, referral or treatment plan, and one exists on file, validate number, member, provider, service, and date(s) of service against claims history. c. Check Clinical Appropriateness of the services provided based on clinical, case, and disease management protocols. d. Perform Prospective Payment Integrity Check. e. If state-defined business rules identify certain audits that cause a claim to suspend, and a claim fails for one or more of them, go to Alternate Path: Suspended Claim below.",

Editing, auditing, and pricing variances could exist on services billed by claim type, provider taxonomy code, service line codes, and the process may require additional information.
