Functionally, linguistically, culturally, and competency appropriate communications are lacking because they are difficult and costly to produce. SMA focuses on meeting compliance thresholds for state and federal regulations using state-specific standards. Very little collaboration occurs with other agencies to standardize information exchange or business tasks.",

SMA accepts inquiries that provider responds to online or by telephone. Communication is functionally, linguistically, culturally, and Manage Provider Communication competency appropriate, but at great expense. SMA limits outreach material by state defined parameters (e.g., only two (2) languages used). SMA applies a mix of HIPAA and state- specific standards. SMA establishes a formal Communications Management Plan. SMA collaborates with other agencies and entities to adopt HIPAA standards and EDI transactions. Manage Provider Communication",

Portal includes usability features or functions that accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities, including those who use assistive technology. SMA automates process to the full extent possible across the intrastate. Use of electronic communications makes provision of functionally, linguistically, culturally, and competency appropriate communications more cost-effective. SMA adopts MITA Framework, industry standards, and other nationally recognized standards for intrastate state exchange of information. SMA collaborates with other intrastate agencies and entities to adopt national standards, and to develop and share reusable business services.",
