          "level_2": "SMA uses a mix of manual and automatic processes to accomplish tasks. The process increases the use of electronic methods. SMA accepts inquiries that provider responds to online or by telephone.",

        "levels": {
          "level_1": "Functionally, linguistically, culturally, and competency appropriate communications are lacking because they are difficult and costly to produce.",
          "level_2": "Communication is functionally, linguistically, culturally, and competency appropriate, but at great expense. SMA limits outreach material by state defined parameters (e.g., only two (2) languages used).",

          "level_2": "Process timeliness improves through use of automation. Providers have access to self-services via a web portal resolving their inquiries themselves.",
          "level_3": "SMA answers most requests in 24 hours or less. Multiple web portals may exist as providers may work with multiple agencies. Timeliness exceeds legal requirements.",
          "level_4": "Timeliness improves via state and federal collaboration, use of information sharing, standards, and regional information exchange hubs. SMA responds to most common inquiries in real-time. Exceptions may require 24 hours or less. SMA integrates web portals so providers have consistent way of communicating. Information is available in near real time. SMA has regional interoperability, which further improves timeliness over Level 3.",
          "level_5": "Information is available in real time. Processes improve further through connectivity with other States and with federal agencies. Most processes execute at the point of service. Results are almost immediate."
