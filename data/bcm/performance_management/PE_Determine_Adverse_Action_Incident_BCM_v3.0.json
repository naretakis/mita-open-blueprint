There is little coordination among SMA programs or between SMA and other stakeholders (e.g., other state agencies, CMS, intermediaries, other payers) in relation to the process. The process consists primarily of manual paper-based activity to accomplish tasks. SMA focuses on meeting compliance thresholds for state and federal regulations using state-specific standards. Very little collaboration occurs with other agencies to standardize information exchange or business tasks.",

SMA automates process with state and federal law enforcement, CMS, and intrastate agencies to the full extent possible within the intrastate. SMA produces audit trail of adverse action decision 100% of the time. SMA adopts MITA Framework, industry standards, and other nationally recognized standards for exchange of information with state and federal law enforcement, CMS, and intrastate agencies. SMA collaborates with other intrastate agencies and entities to adopt national standards, and to develop and share reusable business services with state and federal law enforcement, CMS, and intrastate agencies.",

Case management is primarily a manual process including a desk review of medical records and evidence, request for additional data, on- site audit of provider location, and final disposition and reporting.
