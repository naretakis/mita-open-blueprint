Case management is primarily a manual process including a desk review of medical records and evidence, request for additional data, on- site audit of provider location, and final disposition and reporting. The process requires three (3) months or more from the time SMA identifies the case.",

Timeliness exceeds Level 2.The process requires1 month or less to reach resolution. SMA distributes Notice of appeal rights within 15 minutes or less 100% of the time.",
          "level_4": "Information is available in near real time. Processes that use adverse action incident information result in immediate action, response, and results. SMA has interstate interoperability, which further improves timeliness over Level 3.",
