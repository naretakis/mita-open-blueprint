There is little coordination among SMA programs or between SMA and other stakeholders (e.g., other state agencies, CMS, intermediaries, other payers) in relation to the process. The process consists primarily of manual paper-based activity to accomplish tasks. SMA manually enters parameters for identification of cases. SMA automates exception processing. SMA focuses on meeting compliance thresholds for state and federal regulations using state-specific standards. Very little collaboration occurs with other agencies to standardize information exchange or business tasks.",

SMA adopts MITA Framework, industry standards, and other nationally recognized standards for exchange of information with state and federal law enforcement, CMS, and other intrastate agencies.
