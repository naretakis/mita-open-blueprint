SMA has developed its own unique paper forms to support this process; there may be different forms for each type of treatment plan. Manual rule changes require many business days for approval and implementation. Very little collaboration occurs with other agencies to standardize information exchange or business tasks.",

SMA has adopted the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12 277 Health Care Information Status Notification and 278 Health Care Services Review Information transactions. Although there may be some automation Authorize Treatment Plan of standardized business rules definitions, changes and maintenance are labor intensive, especially in legacy applications. SMA collaborates with other agencies and entities to adopt HIPAA standards and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions.",

Adoption of the separation of standardized intrastate business rules definitions from core programming, available in both human and machine- readable formats. SMA collaborates with other intrastate agencies and entities to adopt national standards, and to develop and share reusable business services.",

Adoption of the separation of regionally standardized business rules definitions from core programming, available in both human and machine- readable formats.
