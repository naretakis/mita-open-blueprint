SMA responses to authorize service request via paper, telephone, or facsimile. SMA focuses on meeting compliance thresholds for state and federal regulations using state-specific standards. SMA develops its own unique paper forms to support this process; there may be different forms per provider type. Manual rule changes require many business days for approval and implementation.

SMA adopts the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12 277 Health Care Information Status Notification and 278 Health Care Services Review Information transactions. Web portals may support Authorize Service error free submissions with information validations, member- side edits, and pre- populated fields, thereby facilitating the process.
