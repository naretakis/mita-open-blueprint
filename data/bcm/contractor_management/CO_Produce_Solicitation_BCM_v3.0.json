          "level_1": "solicitation is necessary. SMA stores the procurement information for manual reuse, and it is not possible to share information. The process consists primarily of manual activity to accomplish tasks. Production of a solicitation consists primarily of manual, paper-based steps. This requires manual compilation of information. Publication of the solicitation and communication with potential respondents is primarily via paper, in person, mail and facsimile. Publication of the solicitation may be via electronic media. Potential respondents can use telephone, facsimile, in person, e-mail, or paper as a way to keep current on any updates during the produce solicitation process. SMA focuses on meeting compliance thresholds for state and federal regulations using state-specific standards. Very little collaboration occurs with other agencies to standardize information exchange or business tasks.",

SMA uses a mix of manual and automatic processes to accomplish tasks. SMA coordinates between agencies electronic contract information from Produce Solicitation central location. Manual compilation of information remains a requirement in some cases. Publication of the solicitation uses electronic media (e.g., Web portal). SMA centralizes contract information, and there is coordination between agencies. SMA automates the publication of the solicitation and communication concerning updates and solicitation status with potential respondents. Produce Solicitation SMA applies a mix of nationally recognized and state-specific standards. SMA collaborates with other agencies and entities to adopt nationally recognized standards and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions.",

SMA automates contract information from central location. SMA automates the process. Some in person communication remains a part of the process. SMA adopts MITA Framework, industry standards, and other nationally recognized standards for intrastate exchange of information. SMA collaborates with other intrastate agencies and entities to adopt national standards, and to develop and share reusable business services.",

SMA automates process to the full extent possible across the interstate. SMA automates process to the full extent possible across the interstate.

SMA collaborates with other interstate agencies and entities to adopt national standards, and to develop and share reusable processes including clinical information.",

The process supports outcome oriented program management, ensures MITA compliance, and supports the shift to shared business services in both the production of solicitations and their content.
