          "level_3": "Timeliness improves via state and federal collaboration, use of information sharing, standards, and regional information exchange hubs. The process supports outcome oriented program management, ensures MITA compliance, and supports the shift to shared business services in both the production of solicitations and their content. The process on average requires less than three (3) months for completion.",
