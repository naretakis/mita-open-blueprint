          "level_1": "The process consists primarily of manual activity to accomplish tasks. SMA conducts the process via mail, in person, and telephone for individual communications; and flyers, radio, TV, newspapers, and publications for public media. SMA is not targeting contractor populations.",
          "level_2": "SMA uses a mix of manual and automatic processes to accomplish tasks. SMA conducts process via a web portal for existing contractors. SMA targets populations to receive communications via mail, in person and telephone for individual communications; and flyers, radio, TV, newspapers, and publications public media.",
          "level_3": "SMA automates process to the full extent possible within the intrastate. The process is electronic. Audience downloads, saves or prints publications. SMA also uses publications the law requires to post solicitations. Portal includes usability features or functions that accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities, including those who use assistive technology.",

        "levels": {
          "level_1": "Process meets threshold or mandated requirements for timeliness (i.e., the process achieves results within the time specified by law or regulation). Timeliness depends on the type of outreach. It is ad hoc in nature. Outreach activity duration is relatively lengthy.",
          "level_2": "Process timeliness improves through use of automation and web portal distribution of information. Timeliness exceeds legal requirements.",
          "level_3": "Timeliness improves via state and federal collaboration, use of information sharing, standards, and regional information exchange hubs. SMA releases alerts and information immediately. Timeliness exceeds Level 2.",
