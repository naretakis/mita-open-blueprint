SMA uses a well- developed automated interface with the Marketplace and CHIP agency. SMA uses interface to transmit case information without human involvement. SMA automates verification for MAGI eligibility and integrates into online application. SMA automates verification for MAGI population to the maximum extent possible. SMA manually executes verification for non-MAGI eligibility.",

SMA takes multiple weeks to complete paper handling and does not have the capacity to adjudicate eligibility without human intervention.",

When electronic data is available and consistent with an applicant’s attestation, applicants who submit the single, streamlined application electronically receive a MAGI determination in near real-time. When necessary, the SMA also transmits electronic application information to agencies administering other insurance affordability programs in near real-time. SMA accepts scanned documents, but takes multiple days or weeks to adjudicate documentation where necessary.",

When electronic data is available and consistent with an applicant’s attestation, applicants who submit the single, streamlined application electronically receive a MAGI determination in near real-time. SMA decreases the time required for determinations that involve other insurance affordability programs using a shared eligibility service. SMA accepts scanned documents, and adjudicates all documents for MAGI-based eligibility within 72 hours of receipt, which further improves timeliness over Level 3.",
          "level_5": "SMA further improves timeliness through increased use of automation. When electronic data is available and consistent with an applicant’s attestation, applicants who submit the single, streamlined application electronically receive a MAGI determination in near real-time. SMA decreases the time required for determinations that involve other insurance affordability programs or non- MAGI eligibility using a shared eligibility service. SMA accepts scanned documents, and adjudicates all documents for MAGI-based eligibility within 24 hours of receipt, and minimizes the time required to adjudicate documents for non- MAGI eligibility."
