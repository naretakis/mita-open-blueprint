SMA submits Inquire Provider Information response via automatic voice response system, web portal, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transaction, personal computer, terminal connection or within batch response parameters. SMA applies a mix of nationally recognized and state-specific standards. SMA collaborates with other agencies and entities to adopt HIPAA standards and Inquire Provider Information EDI transactions.",

SMA adopts MITA Framework, provider inquiry standard messages, and other nationally recognized provider inquiry standards for intrastate exchange of provider enrollment information. SMA collaborates with other intrastate agencies and entities to adopt national provider inquiry standards as well as develop and share reusable business services.",
