          "level_1": "paper-based activity to accomplish tasks. SMA requests medical and dental records via telephone or mail and responder delivers copies in paper format (including X- rays) via mail certified mail and facsimile. SMA focuses on meeting compliance thresholds for state and federal regulations using state-specific standards. Submitter sends paper attachments (i.e., clinical records) separately from the transaction, and then SMA matches the two (2) documents, requiring manual intervention. Validation that the attachment provides the necessary information is a primarily manual process. Very little collaboration occurs with other agencies to standardize information exchange or business tasks.",
          "level_2": "processes to Submit Electronic Attachment accomplish tasks. SMA receives a mix of paper and electronic attachments and returns a mix of electronic and paper formats. SMA applies a mix of HIPAA and state- specific standards. SMA automatically matches electronic attachments to Submit Electronic Attachment corresponding claim. SMA may scan paper attachments, but still associate them manually with the applicable transaction. Some validation is automatic. SMA collaborates with other agencies and entities to adopt HIPAA standards and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions.",
          "level_3": "extent possible within the intrastate. SMA receives the majority of transactions and attachments electronically. SMA continues to accept paper attachments from a small number of providers who still submit paper transactions. SMA adopts MITA Framework, industry standards, and other nationally recognized standards for intrastate exchange of information. SMA requires electronic attachments for electronically submitted transactions, and they accompany the transaction. The implementation of the process as a service per industry standard interface requirements allows automatic validation of attachments. SMA collaborates with other intrastate agencies and entities to adopt national standards, and to develop and share reusable business services.",
          "level_4": "extent possible across the interstate. SMA no longer requires attachments because the payer has direct access to the clinical information stored in the Health Information Exchange (HIE). SMA adopts MITA Framework, industry standards, and other nationally recognized standards for clinical and interstate information exchange. Maturity level is not applicable. SMA automates process to the full extent possible across the interstate. SMA collaborates with other interstate agencies and entities to adopt national standards, and to develop and share reusable processes including clinical information.",
          "level_5": "extent possible across the nation. Through the Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN), SMA can view clinical information stored in Clinical information in any location in the country. Attachments are no longer necessary. SMA adopts MITA Framework, industry standards, and other nationally recognized standards for national exchange of information. Maturity level is not applicable. SMA automates process to the full extent possible across the nation. SMA collaborates with agencies and entities for national (and international) interoperability improvements that maximize automation of routine operations."
