          "level_2": "SMA uses a mix of manual and automatic processes to accomplish tasks. SMA continues to accept paper encounters, but most managed care organizations submit encounters electronically",
          "level_3": "SMA automates process to the full extent possible within the intrastate. Managed care organizations and any other external processor (e.g., Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM), mental health, dental or other agencies) submit all encounters electronically.

Changes to edits, audits and pricing business rules results in unintended downstream processing consequences. Average change takes fewer business days than Level 1.",
          "level_3": "SMA automates process to the full extent possible across the intrastate. Related processes are decoupled, allowing changes in the editing, auditing and pricing standardized business rules definitions without affecting downstream processes.

          "level_1": "Process meets threshold or mandated requirements for timeliness (i.e., the process achieves results within the time specified by law or regulation). Manual processing steps may require multiple business days to complete encounter editing, auditing, or pricing. Suspended encounters require lengthy manual resolution.",
          "level_2": "Process timeliness improves through use of automation. Timeliness exceeds legal requirements. Electronic encounter processing and point- of-sale adjudication greatly increase timeliness. The entire encounter process completes within 24 hours or less.",
          "level_3": "Timeliness improves via state and federal collaboration, use of information sharing, standards, and regional information exchange hubs. Timeliness exceeds Level 2.",
          "level_4": "Information is available in near real time. Processes that use clinical information result in immediate action, response, and results. SMA has interstate interoperability, which further improves timeliness over Level 3.",

Stakeholders are unable to rely on information for decision-making. It is difficult for reviewers to consistently interpret and apply adjudication business rules manually. Unstructured attachment data increases inconsistency of the review process.",

External sources of information use MITA Framework and industry standards for information exchange. Decision- making is automatic using standardized business rules definitions. Accuracy rating is at 99% or higher.",
