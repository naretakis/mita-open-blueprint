          "level_1": "paper-based activity to accomplish tasks. SMA scans or manually enters encounters into an electronic record format. SMA focuses on meeting compliance thresholds for state and federal regulations using state-specific standards. There is little coordination between the portions of SMA responsible for encounter processing. SMA embeds business rules and validations directly into the source code. Changes are difficult, lengthy, and costly. Very little collaboration occurs with other agencies to standardize information exchange or business tasks.",
          "level_2": "automatic processes to accomplish tasks. SMA continues to accept paper encounters, but most managed care organizations submit encounters electronically. Process Encounter SMA applies a mix of HIPAA Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12 837 Health Care Claim and National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) and state-specific standards. SMA receives encounter information electronically or via web sites. SMA centralizes common processes to achieve economies of scale and increase coordination. SMA has mix of automatic business rules definitions and Process Encounter embedded business rules and validation directly into the source code. Changes to edits, audits and pricing business rules results in unintended downstream processing consequences. Average change takes fewer business days than Level 1. SMA collaborates with other agencies and entities to adopt HIPAA standards and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions. Process Encounter",
          "level_3": "extent possible within the intrastate. Managed care organizations and any other external processor (e.g., Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM), mental health, dental or other agencies) submit all encounters electronically. SMA adjudicates encounters via standardized business rules definitions according to methodologies of the National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI). SMA adopts MITA Framework, industry standards, and other nationally recognized standards (e.g., code sets) for encounter processing. SMA fully integrates process between intrastate agencies and other entities. SMA automates process to the full extent possible across the intrastate. Related processes are decoupled, allowing changes in the editing, auditing and pricing standardized business rules definitions without affecting downstream processes. Average changes take less time than Level 2. SMA collaborates with other intrastate agencies and entities to adopt national standards, and to develop and share reusable business services.",
          "level_4": "extent possible via regional standardized business rules definitions. SMA adopts MITA Framework, industry standards, and other nationally recognized standards for interstate encounter processing. SMA integrates process to the full extent possible across the interstate. SMA automates process to the full extent possible by using regional standardized business rules definitions. SMA collaborates with other interstate agencies and entities to adopt national standards, and to develop and share reusable processes including clinical information.",

SMA adopts MITA Framework, industry standards, and other nationally recognized standards for national encounter processing. SMA integrates process to the full extent possible across the nation. SMA automates process to the full extent possible by using national standardized business rules definitions. SMA collaborates with agencies and entities for national (and international) interoperability improvements that maximize automation of routine operations."
