SMA accomplishes the recouping of monies in third party liability situations from payer-to- provider rather than payer-to-payer. There is little coordination between the portions of SMA responsible for recoupments: third party liability, program integrity, and accounting.

Communication to providers and other payers is via telephone, facsimile, and mail; plus, the use of e-mail is increasing and some agencies are sending Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12 837 Health Care Claim transactions directly to other payers rather than from payer to provider to request Manage Provider Recoupment payment. SMA still conducts recouping of monies from payer-to-provider but some payer-to- payer interchanges are taking place.
