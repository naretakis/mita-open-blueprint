    "description": "The Authorize Service business process encompasses both a pre-approved and post-approved service request. This business process focuses on specific types and numbers of visits, procedures, surgeries, tests, drugs, therapies, and durable medical equipment. Its primary use is in a fee-for-services setting. Prior authorization of a service request is a care management function and begins when a care manager requests a service request by mail, facsimile, telephone, or Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12 278 Health Care Services Review Information request transaction. The care manager evaluates requests based on state rules for prioritization such as urgency and type of service/taxonomy (e.g., durable medical equipment, speech, physical therapy, dental, and out-of-state), validates key information, and ensures that requested service is appropriate and medically necessary. After review, staff approves, modifies, denies or suspends for additional information the service requests. The State Medicaid Agency (SMA) sends the appropriate response information for the outbound ASC X12 278 Health Care Services Review Response transaction to the provider using the Send Outbound Transaction.\nNOTE: MITA contains three (3) different authorization business processes: 1. Authorize Service - the standard process of prior authorization of services. 2. Authorize Treatment Plan - the approval of a treatment plan prepared by a care management team in a care management setting. 3. Authorize Referral - specifically the approval of a referral to another provider, requested by a primary care physician. A post-approved service request is an editing/auditing function that requires review of information after the service is complete. A review may consist of verifying documentation to ensure that the services were appropriate and medically necessary, and validating provider type and specialty information to ensure alignment with agency policies and procedures. Post-approved validation typically occurs in the Process Claim or Process Encounter business processes.\nNOTE: This business process is part of a suite that includes Service Requests for different service types and care settings including Medical, Dental, Drugs, and Off- label use of drugs, Social Service, Experimental Treatments, Out-of-State Services, and Emergencies.",
