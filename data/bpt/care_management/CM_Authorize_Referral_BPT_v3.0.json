    "description": "The Authorize Referral business process is responsible for referrals between providers that the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) approves for payment, based on state policy. Examples are referrals by physicians to other providers for laboratory procedures, surgery, drugs, or durable medical equipment. The SMA uses this business process primarily for Primary Care Case Management programs where additional approval controls deemed necessary by the state. Most States do not require this additional layer of control.\nNOTE: MITA contains three (3) different authorization business processes: 1. Authorize Service - the standard process of prior authorization of services. 2. Authorize Treatment Plan - the approval of a treatment plan prepared by a care management team in a care management setting. 3. Authorize Referral - specifically the approval of a referral to another provider, requested by a primary care physician. The Authorize Referral business process may encompass both a pre-approved and post-approved referral request, especial immediate services. This business process may include, but is not limited to, referrals for specific types and numbers of visits, procedures, surgeries, tests, drugs, durable medical equipment, therapies, and institutional days of stay. The SMA evaluates requests based on urgency, state priority requirements, and type of service/taxonomy (durable medical equipment, speech, physical therapy, dental, inpatient, out-of-state). It validates key information, and ensures that the referral is appropriate and medically necessary. After review, staff approves, modifies, suspends for additional information or denies the request. This business process sends an alert to Manage Case Information business process. A post-approved referral request is an editing/auditing function that requires review of information after the referral is complete. A review may consist of verifying documentation to ensure that the referral is appropriate, and medically and/or functionally necessary, and validating provider type and specialty information to ensure alignment with agency policies and procedures. Post-approved validation typically occurs in the Process Claim or Process Encounter business processes.",
