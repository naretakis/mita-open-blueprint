    "description": "Manage Estate Recovery is a business process that requires States to recover certain Medicaid benefits correctly paid on behalf of an individual, by filing liens against a deceased member’s or deceased spouse’s estate to recover the costs of Medicaid benefits correctly paid during the time the member was eligible for Medicaid. Estate recovery usually applies to permanently institutionalized individuals such as persons in a nursing facility, Intermediate Care Facility for Persons with Mental Retardation (ICF/MR), or other medical institution. The Manage Estate Recovery business process begins by receiving estate recovery information from multiple sources (e.g., vital statistics and Social Security Administration (SSA) date of death matches, probate petition notices, tips from caseworkers, and reports of death from nursing homes). It generates correspondence (e.g., demand of notice to probate court via Send Outbound Transaction, to member’s personal representative, generating notice of intent to file claim and exemption questionnaire) via the Manage Applicant and Member Communication business process. In addition, the business process:\n• Opens a formal estate recovery case based on estate ownership and value of property.\n• Determines the value of the estate lien.\n• Files a petition for a lien.\n• Files an estate claim of lien.\n• Conducts case follow-up.\n• Sends an alert to Manage Accounts Receivable Information business process, releasing the estate lien when recovery is complete.\n• Sends an alert to Manage Member Information business process, updating Member data store.\nNOTE: Do not confuse this with settlements that are recoveries for certain Medicaid benefits correctly paid on behalf of an individual because of a legal ruling or award involving accidents.",
