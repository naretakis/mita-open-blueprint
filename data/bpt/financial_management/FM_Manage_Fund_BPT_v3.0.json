    "description": "The Manage Fund business process oversees Medicaid funds, ensures accuracy in their allocation and the reporting of funding sources. Funding for Medicaid services may come from a variety of sources, and often, state funds span across state agency administrations, e.g., Mental Health, Aging, Substance Abuse, physical health, as well as state counties and local jurisdictions. The Manage Fund business process monitors funds through ongoing tracking and reporting of expenditures and corrects any improperly accounted expenditure. It also deals with projected and actual over and under fund allocations. Manage Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (FMAP) The Manage FMAP activity periodically reviews and modifies, as appropriate, FMAP and Enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (enhanced FMAP) rate used. (See 42 CFR 433.10). The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) notifies the state of the FMAP and (enhanced FMAP) that HHS will use in determining the amount of federal matching for state medical assistance (Medicaid), Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) expenditures for a specified federal fiscal year. The State Medicaid Agency (SMA) reviews and approves the FMAP rates for application in enterprise accounting. Manage Federal Financial Participation (FFP) The Manage FFP business activity includes the creation and management of business rules for assigning claims, service payments, and recoveries (including RAC recoveries) to the appropriate FMAP, and the application of administrative costs to the state accounting system. It also includes the oversight of reporting and monitoring Advance Planning Documents or other program documents necessary to secure and maintain FFP. Draw and Report FFP The Draw and Report FFP business activity assures that the SMA properly draws federal funds and reports to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The SMA is responsible for assuring that the correct FFP rate applies to all expenditures in determining the amount of federal funds to draw. When CMS has approved a Medicaid State Plan, it makes quarterly grant awards to the SMA to cover the federal share of expenditures for services, training, and administration. The grant award authorizes the SMA to draw federal funds as needed in accordance with the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) to pay the federal share of disbursements. The SMA receives FFP in expenditures for the CHIP program.",
