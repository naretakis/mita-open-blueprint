    "description": "The Manage Member Financial Participation business process is responsible for all operations aspects of preparing member premium payments. This includes premiums for Medicare, also known as Medicare Buy-in, and other health insurance. The business process begins with the alert to determine if the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) should pay a member’s premium. The SMA will assist low-income Medicare beneficiaries in Medicare cost-sharing, defined as premiums, deductibles, and co-insurance in a process referred to as buy- in. Under the buy-in process the SMA, the Social Security Administration (SSA), and U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) enter into a contract where States pay the Medicare beneficiary share of premium costs, and, in some instances, deductibles, and co-insurance. An exchange of eligibility information between Medicare and the SMA initiates Medicare premium payments. The service agreement between the SMA and business partner determines the intervals for this business process to execute. The business process receives eligibility information from Medicare, performs a matching process against the State Medicaid Enterprise member data store, generates buy-in files to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for verification, receives premium payment information from and generates payments to CMS. The SMA will pay the private health insurance premiums for members who have private health insurance benefits, if it determines the insurance to be cost effective. In these circumstances, the SMA prepares and sends a premium to the member’s private health insurance company. Health insurance premium payment initiates with an application for Medicaid where the applicant indicates they have third-party health coverage or by receiving eligibility information via referrals from Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Offices, schools, community services organizations, or phone calls directly from members. The business process checks for internal eligibility status as well as eligibility with other payers, producing a report identifying individuals where paying premiums would be cost effective, and notifying members via Manage Applicant and Member Communication business process.\nNOTE: This business process does not include sending the premium payments as an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transaction.",
