The business process includes:\n• Retrieving member premium information.\n• Performing required information manipulation according to business rules.\n• Formatting the results into required output information.\n• Sending member premium invoice alert to the Manage Applicant and Member Communication business process.\nNOTE: This business process does not include sending the member premium invoice Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transaction.",
