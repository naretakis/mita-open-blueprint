    "description": "The Prepare Provider Payment business process is responsible for the preparation of the payment report information. Reports sent via email, mail, or Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) to providers and used to reconcile their accounts receivable.\n\nMany Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) are not part of the traditional Medicaid health plan. Services tend to be member specific and often arranged through a plan of care. Atypical providers who render services for HCBS waivers may not have authorization, or may not adjudicate in the same manner as other health care providers. This business process begins with receipt of HCBS information from the Process Claim business process or capitation information from Process Encounter business process, performing required manipulation according to business rules, and formatting the results into the required information. The capitation payment activity includes a per-member-per-month payment for Managed Care Organizations (MCO), Primary Care Case Managers (PCCM), and other capitated programs. This business process begins with a timetable for scheduled correspondence stipulated by Trading Partner Agreement (TPA) and includes retrieving enrollment and benefit transaction information from the Member data store, retrieving the rate information associated with the plan from the Provider or Contractor data store, and formatting the payment into the required information.",
