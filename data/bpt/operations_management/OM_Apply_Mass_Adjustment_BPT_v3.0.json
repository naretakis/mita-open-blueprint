    "description": "The Apply Mass Adjustment business process begins with the receipt or notification of retroactive modifications. These changes may consist of modified rates associated with Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS), Claim Payment/Advice Transaction (CPT), Revenue Codes, or program modifications/conversions that affect payment or reporting. This mass adjustment business process includes identifying the payment transactions such as claims or capitation payment by identifiers (e.g., claim/bill type, HCPCS, CPT, Revenue Code(s), or member identification) that the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) paid incorrectly during a specified date range. The business process applies a predetermined set or sets of parameters that may reverse or amend the paid or denied transactions and repay correctly.\nNOTE: Do not confuse this process with the claim adjustment within the adjudication process. A mass adjustment may involve many previous payments based on a specific date or date range affecting single or multiple providers, members, or other payees. Likewise, mass adjustments historically refer to large- scale modifications in payments as opposed to disenrollment of a group of members from a Managed Care Organization (MCO).",
