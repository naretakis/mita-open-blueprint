    "description": "The Process Encounter business process receives original or adjusted encounter (e.g., institutional, professional, dental, pharmacy, and waiver) information via web or Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transaction and determines its submission status, and based on that:\n• Performs Encounter Edits:\n - Edit a single transaction for valid syntax and format, identifiers and codes, dates, and other information required for the transaction.\n - Validate business edits, service coverage, Third-Party Liability (TPL), and reference coding.\n• Performs Encounter Audits:\n - Verify against historical information.\n - Verify that services requiring authorization have approval, clinical appropriateness, and payment integrity.\n• Suspends encounter that fail edits or audits for return to the provider for corrections, additional information, or internal review according to state defined business rules.\n - Apply National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) Edits.\n - Apply Diagnosis Related Group (DRG)/Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC), as appropriate.\n - Prices Encounters:\n ✓ Calculate state allowed amount.\n ✓ Calculate paid amount.\n ✓ Set paid amount to zero dollars.\nNOTE: All encounters will go through most of the business process steps but with different business rules associated with the different encounter claim types. Both Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and state policy determine business rules for encounter edits, audits, and pricing methodologies. State business rules define whether an encounter goes to a to-be-paid status, suspends, flags for information, or denies. State business rules define whether an edit is fatal or non- fatal as well. See Constraints.\nNOTE: An adjustment to an encounter is on an exception use case to this business process that follows the same process path except it requires a link to the previously submitted processed encounter in order to reverse the original encounter and associate the original and replacement encounter in the calculation information.\nNOTE: This business process is part of a suite including Calculate Spend-down Amount, Submit Electronic Attachment, and Generate Financial Report business processes.",

If electronic encounter submission, perform ASC X12N edits for valid syntax and format, identifiers and codes, dates, and other information required for the transaction according to the agreed-upon levels 1-7 stated in the Trading Partner Agreement.\n    i. If applicable, alert sent to submitter via ASC X12 TA1 Interchange Acknowledgment, 997 Functional Acknowledgment, 999 Implementation Acknowledgment, and/or the 824 Application Advice transaction(s) per Trading Partner Agreement (TPA). END: Business process stops.\n  b. Validate that encounter submission meets filing deadlines based on service dates.\n  c. If applicable, reject encounter for electronic fatal validation errors and send alert to Generate Financial Report business process with error",
      "3. Perform Non-Fatal Edits:\n  a. Determine encounter status as initial, adjustment to a processed encounter, or a duplicate submission that is already in the adjudication process but not yet completed and loaded into encounter payment history (using a unique Patient Account Number).\n    i. If applicable, associate encounter adjustment to original encounter submission.\n  b. Validate provider information (e.g., provider taxonomy, NPI, enrollment status, approved to bill for this service).\n  c. Validate member information (e.g., demographics, eligibility status on the date of service).\n  d. Validate the SMA covers service in member’s health benefit and apply appropriate rules. For example:\n    i. Adult member benefit package does not cover dental services so deny the encounter.\n  e. Validate appropriateness of service codes including correct code set versions, and correct association of services with diagnosis and member demographic and health status.\n  f. If provider submits service authorization, referral or treatment plan number, verify the number, member, provider, service, and date(s) of service.\n  g. If state defined business rules identify certain edits that cause an encounter to suspend, and an encounter fails for one or more of them, send alert to Generate Financial Report business process with error report information. END: Business process stops.",
      "4. Perform Audits:\n  a. Check encounter history for duplicate processed encounter using search key information such as in-house encounter number, date of service, provider and member demographics, service, and diagnosis codes.\n  b. If provider did not submit service authorization, referral or treatment plan, and one exists on file, validate number, member, provider, service, and date(s) of service against claims history.\n  c. Check Clinical Appropriateness of the services provided based on clinical, case, and disease management protocols.\n  d. Perform Prospective Payment Integrity Check.\n  e. If state defined business rules identify certain audits that cause an encounter to suspend, and an encounter fails for one or more of them, send alert to Generate Financial Report business process with error report information. END: Business process stops.",

      "6. If applicable, apply Diagnosis Related Group (DRG)/Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) business rules.",
      "7. Perform Pricing (Shadow-Pricing):\n  a. Calculates state allowed payment amount by applying pricing algorithms (e.g., member-specific pricing, DRG, APC).\n  b. Calculates to-be-paid amount by deducting:\n    i. Contributions provided by Member.\n    ii. Provider advances, liens, and recoupments.",
