    "description": "The Process Claim business process receives original or adjusted claim (e.g., institutional, professional, dental, pharmacy, and waiver) information via web or Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transaction, assigns an internal control number, and\n• Determines its submission status, and based on that:\n - Performs Claims Edits:\n ✓ Edit a single transaction for valid syntax and format, identifiers and codes, dates, and other information required for the transaction.\n ✓ Validate business edits, service coverage, Third-Party Liability (TPL), and reference coding.\n - Performs Claims Audits:\n ✓ Verify against historical information.\n ✓ Verify that services requiring authorization have approval, clinical appropriateness, and payment integrity.\n - Suspends claim that fail edits or audits for return to the provider for corrections, additional information, or internal review according to state defined business rules.\n - Applies National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) Edits.\n - Applies Diagnosis Related Group (DRG)/Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC), as appropriate.\n - Prices Claims:\n ✓ Calculate state allowed amount.\n ✓ Calculate paid amount.\nNOTE: All fee-for-services claim types will go through most of the business process steps but with different business rules associated with the different claim types. Both Centers for Medicaid & Medicaid Services (CMS) and state policy determine business rules for claims edits, audits, and pricing methodologies. State business rules define whether the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) pays, suspends, flags for information, or denies a claim. State business rules define whether an edit is fatal or non-fatal as well. See Constraints.\nNOTE: submitted processed claim in order to reverse the original claim payment and associate the original and replacement claim in the payment information.\nNOTE: This business process is part of a suite including Calculate Spend-down Amount, Submit Electronic Attachment, and Generate Remittance Advice business processes.",

Determine claim status as initial, adjustment to a processed claim, or a duplicate submission that is already in the adjudication process, but not yet completed and loaded into payment history (using a unique Patient Account Number).\n    i. If applicable, associate the claim adjustment to the original claim submission.\n  b. Validate provider information (e.g., provider taxonomy, National Provider Identification (NPI), enrollment status, approved to bill for this service).\n  c. Validate member information (e.g., Member’s eligibility status on the date of service, apply third-party resources to the claim).\n    i. If applicable, alert sent to Manage TPL Recovery business process for third-party insurance.\n  d. Validate member’s health benefit covers the service and apply appropriate rules. For example:\n    i. Because adult member benefit package does not cover dental services, deny the claim.\n    ii. Member is in another health plan that is their primary insurance, and the Medicaid covers the same service. Designate the claim for the Coordination of Benefits (COB) and deny the claim. Under a payer-to- payer business model, the primary payer receives the COB claim.\n  e. Validate appropriateness of service codes including correct code set versions, and correct association of services with diagnosis and member demographic and health status.\n  f. If provider submits service authorization, referral or treatment plan number, verify the number, member, provider, service, and date(s) of service.\n  g.
