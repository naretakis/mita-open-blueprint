    "description": "A person that is not eligible for medical coverage when they have income above the health plan standards may become eligible for coverage through a process called spend-down (see Determine Member Eligibility business process). The Calculate Spend-Down Amount business process is responsible for tracking spend-down amounts and determining if a member meets its responsibility through the submission of medical claims. The Process Claim business process automatically accounts for the spend-down amount during adjudication. Once the member has met the spend-down obligation, a modification of eligibility status allows Medicaid payments to begin and/or resume. This typically occurs in situations where a member has a chronic condition and is consistently above the resource levels, but it may also occur in other situations. The Calculate Spend-Down Amount business process begins with the receipt of member’s health plan information from Enroll Member business process that requires a predetermined amount the member will be financially responsible for prior to Medicaid payment for any medical services.",
