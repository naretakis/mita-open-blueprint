    "description": "The Submit Electronic Attachment business process begins with receiving attachment information that either a payer requests (solicited) or a provider submits (unsolicited). The solicited attachment information can be in response to requests for more information from the following business processes for example: Proce Claim, Process Encounter, Authorize Service, Authorize Treatment Plan, and Manage Estate Recovery. The business process links attachment information to the associated applicable transaction (e.g., claim, prior authorization, treatment plan) or suspends for a predetermined time set by state specific business rules, after which the business process purges information. The business process validates the successfully associated attachment information using application-level edits, determining whether the information provides the additional information necessary to adjudicate (i.e., approve, suspend or deny) the transaction.",
