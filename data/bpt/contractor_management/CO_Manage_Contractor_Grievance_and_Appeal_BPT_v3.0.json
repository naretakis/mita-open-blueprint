    "description": "The Manage Contractor Grievance and Appeal business process handles contractor (e.g., managed care, at-risk mental health or dental care, primary care physician) appeals* of adverse decisions or communications of a grievance. The Manage Contractor Communication business process initiates a grievance or appeal. The State Medicaid Agency (SMA) logs and tracks the grievance or appeal; it triages to appropriate reviewers; it researches it; it may request additional information; it schedules and conducts a hearing in accordance with legal requirements; and it makes a ruling based upon the evidence presented. Staff documents and distributes results of the hearings, and adds relevant documents to the contractor’s information. Agency formally notifies contractor of the decision. Th process by providing information about the types of grievances and appeals it handles; grievance and appeals issues; parties that file or are the target of the grievances and appeals; and the dispositions. This information used to discern program improvement opportunities, which may reduce the issues that give rise to grievances and appeals. Based on the appeal business process, if a contractor wins an appeal that impacts or clarifies a Medicaid State Plan, health plan, or health benefit this process sends that information to Maintain State Plan, Manage Health Plan Information or Manage Health Benefit Information business processes to modify the relevant policy or procedure. Disposition could result in legislative change requirements that will be communicated to lawmakers. NOTE: States may define grievance and appeal differently, perhaps because of state laws. *This business process supports grievances and appeals for both prospective and current contractors. A non-enrolled contractor can file a grievance or appeal, for example, when agency does not award a contract to contractor. Protests received from prospective contractors are addressed in the Award Contract business process",
