    "description": "The Identify Utilization Anomalies business process uses criteria and rules to identify target groups (e.g., providers, contractors, trading partners or members) and establishes patterns or parameters of acceptable and unacceptable behavior, tests individuals against these models, or looks for new and unusual patterns, in order to identify outliers that demonstrate suspicious utilization of program benefits. Internal and external referrals, business intelligence analysis (i.e., historical, current, and predictive views of business operations), and scheduled or on-demand reporting may identify a compliance incident. Identification of utilization anomalies include evaluation of:\n• Provider utilization review\n• Provider compliance review\n• Contractor utilization review (includes managed care organizations)\n• Contractor compliance review\n• Member utilization review\n• Investigation of potential fraud or abuse review\n• Drug utilization review\n• Quality review (e.g., Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAPHS) and Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures)\n• Performance review (e.g., Key Performance Indicator (KPI))\n• Erroneous payment\n• Contract review\n• Audit Review\n• Other evaluation of information Different criteria and rules, relationships, and information define each type of compliance incident and require different types of external investigation.",
