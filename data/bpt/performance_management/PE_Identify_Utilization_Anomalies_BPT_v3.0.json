    "description": "The Identify Utilization Anomalies business process uses criteria and rules to identify target groups (e.g., providers, contractors, trading partners or members) and establishes patterns or parameters of acceptable and unacceptable behavior, tests individuals against these models, or looks for new and unusual patterns, in order to identify outliers that demonstrate suspicious utilization of program benefits. Internal and external referrals, business intelligence analysis (i.e., historical, current, and predictive views of business operations), and scheduled or on-demand reporting may identify a compliance incident. Identification of utilization anomalies include evaluation of:\n\u2022 Provider utilization review\n\u2022 Provider compliance review\n\u2022 Contractor utilization review (includes managed care organizations)\n\u2022 Contractor compliance review\n\u2022 Member utilization review\n\u2022 Investigation of potential fraud or abuse review\n\u2022 Drug utilization review\n\u2022 Quality review (e.g., Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAPHS) and Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures)\n\u2022 Performance review (e.g., Key Performance Indicator (KPI))\n\u2022 Erroneous payment\n\u2022 Contract review\n\u2022 Audit Review\n\u2022 Other evaluation of information\n\nDifferent criteria and rules, relationships, and information define each type of compliance incident and require different types of external investigation.",
