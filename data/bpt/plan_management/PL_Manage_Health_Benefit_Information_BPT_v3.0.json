    "description": "The Manage Health Benefit Information business process includes the activities for development and implementation of health benefit packages to accommodate service delivery to targeted member populations.\nThe health benefit package accommodates information to support current and future health benefit packages for members eligible for programs administered by the State Medicaid Agency (SMA). The SMA determines benefit terms and limitations, and applicable periods for services defined within a health benefit package.\n Health benefit package administration involves the ability to determine, define and coordinate and modify the following parameters within the SMA, as the Medicaid Enterprise policies, funding and business decisions dictate:\n• Multiple health benefit package definitions targeted to specific populations.\n• Service categories to define available covered service.\n• Federal and state regulations define service limitations to restrict utilization.\n• Customization of edits and audits relative to SMA policy.\n• Utilization tracking of limited services at the member level.\n• Generation of state and federal reporting requirements.",
