Determine Provider Eligibility business process sends enrollment determination alert signals to subscribing business processes Enroll Provider and Manage Provider Communication. Determine Provider Eligibility sends alert signal to Manage Accounts Receivable Funds business process to collect application fee.\n The Determine Provider Eligibility business process works in conjunction with Medicare and the processing of dual eligibles.
