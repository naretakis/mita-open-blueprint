    "description": "The Determine Member Eligibility business process is responsible for the operational aspects of determining if an applicant is eligible for Medicaid or potentially eligible for other insurance affordability programs (e.g., Advance Premium Tax Credits through the Health Insurance Marketplace (HIX) commonly referred to as the Marketplace. Children’s Health Insurance Program [CHIP], and/or Basic Health Program [BHP]). An applicant submits an application or a member updates account information via online, in person, over the phone, by mail, or by other commonly available electronic means. The business process checks for status (e.g., new, resubmission, redetermination, duplicate, or referral from the Health Insurance Marketplace or other agencies administering insurance affordability programs) and verifies applicant information in accordance with the policies established. The business process determines eligibility based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) or on a basis other than MAGI methods including group/category (e.g., parents/caretaker relatives, pregnant women, children under 19 year of age). The business process also assigns a Medicaid ID, associates the benefit packages, and produces notifications for coordinated communications. When required, the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) submits applicant or member eligibility information and/or eligibility determination to other agencies administering insurance affordability programs and CMS information systems. This business process could be a Shared Eligibility Service between the Medicaid Agency, the Health Insurance Marketplace, and other State-based insurance affordability programs such as CHIP or BHP. NOTE: Applications and Accounts: An individual seeking eligibility for enrollment in an insurance affordability program completes and submits an application on-line, in person, over the phone, by mail, or paper application for verification and eligibility determination. Accepted application data is managed in an “electronic account” (as defined in 42 CFR 435.4) by the receiving program to enable access to this information during the verification and eligibility determination processes, as well as after the conclusion of the process to support change reporting and for other purposes.",
