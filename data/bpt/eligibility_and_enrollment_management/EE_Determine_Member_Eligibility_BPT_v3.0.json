    "description": "The Determine Member Eligibility business process is responsible for the operational aspects of determining if an applicant is eligible for Medicaid or potentially eligible for other insurance affordability programs (e.g., Advance Premium Tax Credits through the Health Insurance Marketplace (HIX) commonly referred to as the Marketplace. Children’s Health Insurance Program [CHIP], and/or Basic Health Program [BHP]). An applicant submits an application or a member updates account information via online, in person, over the phone, by mail, or by other commonly available electronic means. The business process checks for status (e.g., new, resubmission, redetermination, duplicate, or referral from the Health Insurance Marketplace or other agencies administering insurance affordability programs) and verifies applicant information in accordance with the policies established. The business process determines eligibility based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) or on a basis other than MAGI methods including group/category (e.g., parents/caretaker relatives, pregnant women, children under 19 year of age). The business process also assigns a Medicaid ID, associates the benefit packages, and produces notifications for coordinated communications. When required, the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) submits applicant or member eligibility information and/or eligibility determination to other agencies administering insurance affordability programs and CMS information systems. This business process could be a Shared Eligibility Service between the Medicaid Agency, the Health Insurance Marketplace, and other State-based insurance affordability programs such as CHIP or BHP. NOTE: Applications and Accounts: An individual seeking eligibility for enrollment in an insurance affordability program completes and submits an application on-line, in person, over the phone, by mail, or paper application for verification and eligibility determination. Accepted application data is managed in an “electronic account” (as defined in 42 CFR 435.4) by the receiving program to enable access to this information during the verification and eligibility determination processes, as well as after the conclusion of the process to support change reporting and for other purposes.",

      "1. START: a. Receive completed application from applicant via online or by other commonly available electronic means, in person, over the phone, or by mail, or receive initial assessment from another insurance affordability program; or NOTE: The use of the internet website (online portal) will include not only field-level edits but will also perform data verification, as appropriate, throughout the application preparation and update process as well as determine if the account already exists (in the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid and/or CHIP) and the status of application/account. b. Initiate renewal process when member’s response to renewal notice is received or when changes to existing member account is updated with new information from other data source(s); or c. Receive information about an auto-eligible. Go to Alternate Scenario 1.",
      "2. Verify the following non-financial requirements for eligibility determination. CMS expects the State to use Federal or local electronic data sources as available. The State may also rely on self-attestation for all eligibility criteria other than citizenship and satisfactory immigration status, as described in Section H of the preamble of the Medicaid Final Eligibility Rule. Resolve discrepancies by identifying non- financial factors that do not meet verification based on data matches or self- attestation and request additional information as necessary. a. Verify State residency. b. Verify the SSN. c. Verify citizenship or satisfactory immigration status. d. If applicable, verify whether individual is an American Indian/Alaska Native, in accordance with established procedure. Note: American Indian/Alaska Native status is not a condition of eligibility for Medicaid. e. If applicable, verify individual incarceration status. Note: Incarceration status is not a condition of eligibility for Medicaid. f. Pregnancy. Note: The Agency must accept self-attestation of pregnancy unless the State has information that is not reasonably compatible with such attestation. g. Age, date of birth and household size. Note: The Agency may accept self- attestation of date of birth and the individuals that comprise an individual’s household or may verify through other reasonable verification procedures. h. Other non-financial factors (e.g., full-time student status, categorical eligibility as a parent or other caretaker relative as defined in 42 CFR",
      "435. 4). Verify Other Health Coverage",
      "3. Verify enrollment in other health coverage, including Medicare, other public programs, as well as private coverage. Note: Enrollment in private health coverage is not a barrier to Medicaid eligibility except as an optional targeted low-income child or as a woman needing treatment for breast or cervical cancer. Medicare recipients are exempted from certain eligibility groups, while Medicare coverage is required for certain other eligibility groups. Verify Financial Information",
      "4. Verify financial information (42 CFR 435.948) provided by the applicant or member,",
      "5. Verify asset information if applicant has requested to be evaluated for Medicaid eligibility based on a non-MAGI group that requires an asset test.

      "6. Use results from verification processes and other application data to assess and determine whether the individual meets the non-financial factors for eligibility: a. If individual meets residency requirement, go to Step 6b. If not, go to Step 12 to deny Medicaid. b. If individual is a verified citizen, go to Step 6d. If not, continue to Step 6c. c. If individual meets satisfactory immigration status requirements, go to Step 6d. If not, flag individual for coverage of emergency medical services and proceed to Step 6d. d. If individual is requesting only a non-MAGI eligibility determination, go to",

Assess whether individual is age 19 or older and under age 65, not",
      "8. Assess and determine individual’s eligibility based on optional MAGI groups. States may choose to offer any or all of the optional groups listed in Table 2. Verify (by self- attestation or otherwise) any additional non-financial factors of eligibility for the relevant optional group(s).",
      "9. Prior to approving or denying Medicaid eligibility, assess and determine if individual is eligible for a Medicare Savings Program. Note: See Medicare Savings Program Groups Table 3. a. Determine if individual is enrolled in Medicare Part A or B. If enrolled in Medicare Part A or B, go to Step 9b. If not, go to Step 9c. b. Determine if individual is eligible for a Medicare Savings Program Group. If the individual is eligible based on MSP criteria, go to Step 14 to assign groups and benefit level. If not, go Step 9c. c.

If not, go to Step 10b. b. If individual was previously determined eligible based on MAGI, no further action required. If not, go to 10c. c. If individual is flagged for emergency medical services only, go to Step 12 to deny Medicaid. If not go to Step 9 to assess and determine Medicare Savings Program (MSP) eligibility NOTE: Although the individual was flagged for emergency medical services, the individual has failed all other income tests and the screening for potential non-MAGI and should be denied coverage for emergency medical services.
