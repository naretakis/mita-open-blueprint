    "description": "The Enroll Member business process receives eligibility information from the Determine Member Eligibility business process, the Health Insurance Marketplace, or any insurance affordability program (e.g., Children’s Health Insurance Program [CHIP] or Basic Health Program [BHP]). It determines additional qualifications for enrollment in health benefits for which the member is eligible, and produces notifications for coordination of communications to the member, provider, and to the insurance affordability programs. The Marketplace, Agency or enrollment brokers may perform some or all of the steps in this business process.\n\nNOTE: There is a separate business process for Disenroll Member.\nNOTE: Applications and Accounts - An individual seeking eligibility for enrollment in a qualified health plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace, advance premium tax credits, cost-sharing reductions, Medicaid, CHIP or BHP completes and submits an on-line, telephone, in-person, or paper application for verification and eligibility determination. The Health Insurance Marketplace or insurance affordability program accepts application data and manages information in an “account” by the receiving program to enable access to this information during the verification and eligibility determination processes, as well as after the conclusion of the process to support change reporting and for other purposes.",
