    "description": "The Terminate Provider business process is responsible for the termination of provider agreement to participate in the Medicaid Program. The basis for termination can be: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) terminate a provider agreement if an individual provider: o Is not in substantial compliance with the requirements of participation, regardless of whether immediate jeopardy is present; o Provider does not meet the eligibility criteria for continuation of payment as set forth in 42 CFR 488.412(a)(1). CMS and the state may terminate a facility's provider agreement if a facility: o Is not in substantial compliance with the requirements of participation, regardless of whether immediate jeopardy is present; or o Facility fails to submit an acceptable Corrective Action Plan (CAP) within the timeframe specified by CMS or the SMA. CMS and the SMA terminate a facility's provider agreement if a facility: o Fails to relinquish control to the temporary manager, if CMS or the SMA imposes that remedy; or o Facility does not meet the eligibility criteria for continuation of payment as set forth in 42 CFR 488.412(a)(1). The effect of termination of the provider agreement ends: (1) payment to the facility, and (2) any alternative remedy.",
