    "description": "The Manage Provider Grievance and Appeal business process handles provider* appeals of adverse decisions or communications of a grievance. The Manage Provider Communication business process initiates a grievance or appeal from a provider. The State Medicaid Agency (SMA) logs and tracks the grievance or appeal, triages it, and sends it to appropriate reviewers. Staff researches or requests additional information. The SMA may schedule a hearing, conduct actions in accordance with legal requirements, and make a ruling based upon the evidence presented. Staff documents and distributes results of the hearings, and adds relevant documents to the provider’s information. S the decision. This business process supports the Manage Performance Measures business process by providing information about the types of grievances and appeals it handles, grievance and appeals issues, parties that file or are the target of the grievances and appeals, and the dispositions. The SMA uses information to discern program improvement opportunities, which may reduce the issues that give rise to grievances and appeals. Based on the appeal business process, if a provider wins an appeal that affects or clarifies a Medicaid State Plan, health plan, or health benefit, this process sends that information to Maintain State Plan, Manage Health Plan Information or Manage Health Benefit Information business processes to modify the relevant policy or procedure. Disposition could result in legislative change requirements that the SMA will communicate to lawmakers. NOTE: States may define grievance and appeal differently, depending on state laws. States may involve multiple agencies in the Manage Provider Grievance and Appeal business process. *This business process supports grievances and appeals for both prospective providers and current providers. A non-enrolled provider can file a grievance or appeal, for example, when SMA denies an application for enrollment.",
