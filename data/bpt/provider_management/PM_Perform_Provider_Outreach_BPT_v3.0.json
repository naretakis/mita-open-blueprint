    "description": "The Perform Provider Outreach business process originates internally within the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) in response to multiple activities (e.g., identified gaps in medical service coverage, public health alerts, provider complaints, medical breakthroughs, modifications in the Medicaid Program policies and procedures). SMA may develop prospective Provider outreach information, also referred to as Provider Recruiting information, for targeted providers identified by analyzing program information (for example, not enough dentists to serve a population, new immigrants need language-compatible providers). Enrolled Provider outreach information may relate to corrections in billing practices, public health alerts, public service announcements, drive to sign up more Primary Care Physicians, and other objectives. The State Medicaid Agency develops outreach information for target populations identified by analyzing member information. The State Medicaid Agency may communicate information in a variety of methods such as email, mail, publication, mobile device, facsimile, telephone, web or Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). The State Medicaid Agency produces, distributes, tracks and archives all contractor outreach communications according to state rules. The Manage Performance Measures business process defines benchmarks and measures outreach efficacy. NOTE: The Perform Provider Outreach business process targets both prospective and current provider populations for distribution of information about programs, policies, and health issues. Manage Provider Communication business process handles inquiry from applicants, prospective and current providers by providing assistance and responses to individuals (i.e., bi-directional communication).",
