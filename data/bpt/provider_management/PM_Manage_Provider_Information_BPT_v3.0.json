    "description": "The Manage Provider Information business process is responsible for managing all operational aspects of the Provider data store, which is the source of comprehensive information about prospective and contracted providers and their interactions with the State Medicaid Agency (SMA). The Provider data store is the SMA Source of Record (SOR) for provider demographic, business, credentialing, enumeration, performance profiles, payment processing, and tax information. The data store includes contractual terms (e.g., the services the provider is to provide) related performance measures, and the reimbursement rates for those services. In addition, the Provider data store contains records about and tracks the processing of provider enrollment applications, credentialing and enumeration verification, and all communications with or about the provider, including provider verification requests and responses, and interactions related to any grievance/appeal. The Provider data store may store records or pointers to records for services requested and services provided, performance, utilization, and program integrity reviews, and participation in member care management. Business processes that generate prospective or contracted provider information send requests to the Member data store to add, delete, or modify information. The Provider data store validates information upload requests, applies instructions, and tracks activity. The Provider data store provides access to provider records to applications and staff via batch record transfers, responses to queries, and subscription services.",
