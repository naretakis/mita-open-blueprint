Item 
Details 
Description 
The Prepare Provider Payment business process is responsible for the 
preparation of the payment report information. Reports sent via email, mail, or 
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) to providers and used to reconcile their accounts 
receivable.  
Many Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) are not part of the traditional 
Medicaid health plan. Services tend to be member specific and often arranged 
through a plan of care. Atypical providers who render services for HCBS waivers 
may not have authorization, or may not adjudicate in the same manner as other 
health care providers. This business process begins with receipt of HCBS 
information from the Process Claim business process or capitation information 
from Process Encounter business process, performing required manipulation 
according to business rules, and formatting the results into the required information. 
The capitation payment activity includes a per-member-per-month payment for 
Managed Care Organizations (MCO), Primary Care Case Managers (PCCM), and 
other capitated programs. This business process begins with a timetable for 
scheduled correspondence stipulated by Trading Partner Agreement (TPA) and 
includes retrieving enrollment and benefit transaction information from the Member 
data store, retrieving the rate information associated with the plan from the Provider 
or Contractor data store, and formatting the payment into the required information. 
Trigger Event 
Interaction-based Trigger Events to include but not limited to: 
 
Alert from Process Claim business process to prepare HCBS payment. 


Process Encounter 
Item 
Details 
Description 
The Process Encounter business process receives original or adjusted encounter 
(e.g., institutional, professional, dental, pharmacy, and waiver) information via web or 
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transaction and determines its submission status, 
and based on that: 
 
Performs Encounter Edits: 
o 
Edit a single transaction for valid syntax and format, identifiers and codes, 
dates, and other information required for the transaction.  
o 
Validate business edits, service coverage, Third-Party Liability (TPL), and 
reference coding. 
 
Performs Encounter Audits: 
o 
Verify against historical information. 
o 
Verify that services requiring authorization have approval, clinical 
appropriateness, and payment integrity. 
 
Suspends encounter that fail edits or audits for return to the provider for 
corrections, additional information, or internal review according to state defined 
business rules. 
o 
Apply National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) Edits. 
o 
Apply Diagnosis Related Group (DRG)/Ambulatory Payment Classification 
(APC), as appropriate. 
o 
Prices Encounters: 
 Calculate state allowed amount. 
 Calculate paid amount. 
 Set paid amount to zero dollars. 
NOTE: All encounters will go through most of the business process steps but with 
different business rules associated with the different encounter claim types. Both 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and state policy determine 
business rules for encounter edits, audits, and pricing methodologies. State business 
rules define whether an encounter goes to a to-be-paid status, suspends, flags for 
information, or denies. State business rules define whether an edit is fatal or non-
fatal as well. See Constraints. 
NOTE: An adjustment to an encounter is on an exception use case to this business 
process that follows the same process path except it requires a link to the previously 
submitted processed encounter in order to reverse the original encounter and 
associate the original and replacement encounter in the calculation information. 
NOTE: This business process is part of a suite including Calculate Spend-down 
Amount, Submit Electronic Attachment, and Generate Financial Report 
business processes.

Constraints 
All encounter claim types will go through most of the steps within the Process 
Encounter business process main flow with some variance of business rules and 
information. Types of counter variances include: Institutional, Professional, Dental, 
Pharmacy, and Waiver encounters; Medicare Crossover and Medicare Part D 
pharmacy encounters; and Coordination of Benefits (COB) encounters received from 
payers secondary to Medicaid (e.g., for IHS eligibles). 
The business rules will conform to federal and state-specific rules and pricing 
algorithms. Editing, auditing, and pricing variances could exist on services billed by 
encounter claim type, provider taxonomy code, service line codes, and the process 
may require additional information. 
An adjustment to an encounter follows the same business process path except that it 
requires a link to the previously submitted and processed encounter in order to 
reverse the original encounter and associate the original to the adjustment. 
Failures 
The Process Encounter business process contains a series of potential points of 
failure. The encounter could fail any edit or audit. Business rules define whether one 
or more edit or audit failures will result in suspending or denying the encounter. 
Fatal Edit Failures: Encounter information has fatal edit error. For example: 
 
Encounter submitted without all the required information. 
 
Encounter submitted after encounter filing deadline. 
Other Edit Failures: Encounter information has other errors. For example: 
 
The SMA does not cover the service because it is not in the health benefit, or is 
not in an approved facility or performed by an approved provider type. 
 
Service is not appropriate based on member demographics.



Description 
A person that is not eligible for medical coverage when they have income above the 
health plan standards may become eligible for coverage through a process called 
spend-down (see Determine Member Eligibility business process). 
The Calculate Spend-Down Amount business process is responsible for tracking 
spend-down amounts and determining if a member meets its responsibility through 
the submission of medical claims. The Process Claim business process 
automatically accounts for the spend-down amount during adjudication. Once the 
member has met the spend-down obligation, a modification of eligibility status allows 
Medicaid payments to begin and/or resume. This typically occurs in situations where 
a member has a chronic condition and is consistently above the resource levels, but 
it may also occur in other situations. 
The Calculate Spend-Down Amount business process begins with the receipt of 
member’s health plan information from Enroll Member business process that 
requires a predetermined amount the member will be financially responsible for prior 
to Medicaid payment for any medical services. 
Trigger Event 
Interaction-based Trigger Events to include but not limited to: 
 
Receive health plan information from Enroll Member business process. 
Result 




Description 
The Apply Mass Adjustment business process begins with the receipt or 
notification of retroactive modifications. These changes may consist of modified 
rates associated with Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS), 
Claim Payment/Advice Transaction (CPT), Revenue Codes, or program 
modifications/conversions that affect payment or reporting. This mass adjustment 
business process includes identifying the payment transactions such as claims or 
capitation payment by identifiers (e.g., claim/bill type, HCPCS, CPT, Revenue 
Code(s), or member identification) that the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) paid 
incorrectly during a specified date range. The business process applies a 
predetermined set or sets of parameters that may reverse or amend the paid or 
denied transactions and repay correctly.  
NOTE: Do not confuse this process with the claim adjustment within the 
adjudication process. A mass adjustment may involve many previous payments 
based on a specific date or date range affecting single or multiple providers, 
members, or other payees. Likewise, mass adjustments historically refer to large-
scale modifications in payments as opposed to disenrollment of a group of members 
from a Managed Care Organization (MCO).
