Description 
The Determine Member Eligibility business process is responsible for the operational 
aspects of determining if an applicant is eligible for Medicaid or potentially eligible for 
other insurance affordability programs (e.g., Advance Premium Tax Credits through the 
Health Insurance Marketplace (HIX) commonly referred to as the Marketplace. 
Children’s Health Insurance Program [CHIP], and/or Basic Health Program [BHP]).  
An applicant submits an application or a member updates account information via 
online, in person, over the phone, by mail, or by other commonly available electronic 
means. The business process checks for status (e.g., new, resubmission, 
redetermination, duplicate, or referral from the Health Insurance Marketplace or other 
agencies administering insurance affordability programs) and verifies applicant 
information in accordance with the policies established. The business process 
determines eligibility based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) or on a basis 
other than MAGI methods including group/category (e.g., parents/caretaker relatives, 
pregnant women, children under 19 year of age).  The business process also assigns a 
Medicaid ID, associates the benefit packages, and produces notifications for 
coordinated communications. When required, the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) 
submits applicant or member eligibility information and/or eligibility determination to 
other agencies administering insurance affordability programs and CMS information 
systems. 
This business process could be a Shared Eligibility Service between the Medicaid 
Agency, the Health Insurance Marketplace, and other State-based insurance 
affordability programs such as CHIP or BHP.  
NOTE: Applications and Accounts: An individual seeking eligibility for enrollment in 
an insurance affordability program completes and submits an application on-line, in 
person, over the phone, by mail, or paper application for verification and eligibility 
determination.  Accepted application data is managed in an “electronic account” (as 
defined in 42 CFR 435.4) by the receiving program to enable access to this information 
during the verification and eligibility determination processes, as well as after the 
conclusion of the process to support change reporting and for other purposes.
