immediate services.  
This business process may include, but is not limited to, referrals for specific types 
and numbers of visits, procedures, surgeries, tests, drugs, durable medical 
equipment, therapies, and institutional days of stay.  
The SMA evaluates requests based on urgency, state priority requirements, and 
type of service/taxonomy (durable medical equipment, speech, physical therapy, 
dental, inpatient, out-of-state). It validates key information, and ensures that the 
referral is appropriate and medically necessary. After review, staff approves, 
modifies, suspends for additional information or denies the request. This business 
process sends an alert to Manage Case Information business process. 
A post-approved referral request is an editing/auditing function that requires review 
of information after the referral is complete. A review may consist of verifying 
documentation to ensure that the referral is appropriate, and medically and/or 
functionally necessary, and validating provider type and specialty information to 
ensure alignment with agency policies and procedures. Post-approved validation 
typically occurs in the Process Claim or Process Encounter business processes.

CM Authorization Determination 
Authorize Service 
Item 
Details 
Description 
The Authorize Service business process encompasses both a pre-approved and 
post-approved service request. This business process focuses on specific types and 
numbers of visits, procedures, surgeries, tests, drugs, therapies, and durable 
medical equipment. Its primary use is in a fee-for-services setting. 
Prior authorization of a service request is a care management function and begins 
when a care manager requests a service request by mail, facsimile, telephone, or 
Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12 278 Health Care Services Review 
Information request transaction. The care manager evaluates requests based on 
state rules for prioritization such as urgency and type of service/taxonomy (e.g., 
durable medical equipment, speech, physical therapy, dental, and out-of-state), 
validates key information, and ensures that requested service is appropriate and 
medically necessary. After review, staff approves, modifies, denies or suspends for 
additional information the service requests. The State Medicaid Agency (SMA) 
sends the appropriate response information for the outbound ASC X12 278 Health 
Care Services Review Response transaction to the provider using the Send 
Outbound Transaction.  
NOTE: MITA contains three (3) different authorization business processes: 
1. Authorize Service – the standard process of prior authorization of services. 
2. Authorize Treatment Plan – the approval of a treatment plan prepared by a 
care management team in a care management setting. 
3. Authorize Referral – specifically the approval of a referral to another 
provider, requested by a primary care physician. 
A post-approved service request is an editing/auditing function that requires review 
of information after the service is complete. A review may consist of verifying 
documentation to ensure that the services were appropriate and medically 
necessary, and validating provider type and specialty information to ensure 
alignment with agency policies and procedures. Post-approved validation typically 
occurs in the Process Claim or Process Encounter business processes. 
NOTE: This business process is part of a suite that includes Service Requests for 
different service types and care settings including Medical, Dental, Drugs, and Off-
label use of drugs, Social Service, Experimental Treatments, Out-of-State Services, 
and Emergencies. 
Trigger Event 
Interaction-based Trigger Events to include but not limited to:  
 
Receive service request from Health Information Exchange (HIE) via ASC X12 
278 Health Care Services Review Request and Response transaction. 
 
Receive service request from requestor via ASC X12 278 Health Care Services 
Review Request and Response transaction. 
Environment-based Trigger Events to include but not limited to:  
 
Provider submits a request for service in accordance with state policy. 
 
Provider submits additional information for existing service authorization request.

Description 
The Authorize Treatment Plan business process encompasses both a prior 
authorization and post-approved treatment plan. The State Medicaid Agency (SMA) 
uses the Authorize Treatment Plans primarily in the care coordination setting where 
the care management team assesses the member’s needs, decides on a course of 
treatment, and completes the treatment plan.  
NOTE: MITA contains three (3) different authorization business processes:

2. Authorize Treatment Plan – the approval of a treatment plan prepared by a 
care management team in a care management setting. 
3. Authorize Referral – specifically the approval of a referral to another 
provider, requested by a primary care physician. 
A treatment plan prior-authorizes the named providers or provider types and 
services or category of services. The SMA prior authorizes individual providers for 
the service or category of services, and they do not have to submit their own prior 
authorizations or service requests. A treatment plan typically is a schedule of
