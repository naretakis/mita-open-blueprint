[x= 178.9 y= 172.5] Manage Member Financial Participation
[x= 369.4 y= 172.5] business process is responsible for
[x= 158.8 y= 184.0] all operations aspects of preparing member premium payments. This includes
[x= 158.8 y= 195.5] premiums for Medicare, also known as Medicare Buy-in, and other health insurance.
[x= 158.8 y= 207.0] The business process begins with the alert to determine if the State Medicaid
[x= 158.8 y= 218.5] Agency (SMA) should pay a member’s premium.
[x= 158.8 y= 236.0] The SMA will assist low-income Medicare beneficiaries in Medicare cost-sharing,
[x= 158.8 y= 247.5] defined as premiums, deductibles, and co-insurance in a process referred to as buy-
[x= 158.8 y= 259.0] in. Under the buy-in process the SMA, the Social Security Administration (SSA), and
[x= 158.8 y= 270.5] U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) enter into a contract where
[x= 158.8 y= 282.0] States pay the Medicare beneficiary share of premium costs, and, in some
[x= 158.8 y= 293.5] instances, deductibles, and co-insurance.
[x= 158.8 y= 311.0] An exchange of eligibility information between Medicare and the SMA initiates
[x= 158.8 y= 322.5] Medicare premium payments. The service agreement between the SMA and
[x= 158.8 y= 334.0] business partner determines the intervals for this business process to execute. The
[x= 158.8 y= 345.5] business process receives eligibility information from Medicare, performs a matching
[x= 158.8 y= 357.0] process against the State Medicaid Enterprise member data store, generates buy-in
[x= 158.8 y= 368.5] files to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for verification, receives
[x= 158.8 y= 380.0] premium payment information from and generates payments to CMS.
[x= 158.8 y= 397.5] The SMA will pay the private health insurance premiums for members who have
[x= 158.8 y= 409.0] private health insurance benefits, if it determines the insurance to be cost effective.
[x= 158.8 y= 420.5] In these circumstances, the SMA prepares and sends a premium to the member’s
[x= 158.8 y= 432.0] private health insurance company.
[x= 158.8 y= 449.5] Health insurance premium payment initiates with an application for Medicaid where
[x= 158.8 y= 461.0] the applicant indicates they have third-party health coverage or by receiving eligibility
[x= 158.8 y= 472.5] information via referrals from Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS)
[x= 158.8 y= 484.0] Offices, schools, community services organizations, or phone calls directly from
[x= 158.8 y= 495.5] members. The business process checks for internal eligibility status as well as

Manage Member Financial Participation 
Item 
Details 
Description 
The Manage Member Financial Participation business process is responsible for 
all operations aspects of preparing member premium payments. This includes 
premiums for Medicare, also known as Medicare Buy-in, and other health insurance. 
The business process begins with the alert to determine if the State Medicaid 
Agency (SMA) should pay a member’s premium. 
The SMA will assist low-income Medicare beneficiaries in Medicare cost-sharing, 
defined as premiums, deductibles, and co-insurance in a process referred to as buy-
in. Under the buy-in process the SMA, the Social Security Administration (SSA), and 
U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) enter into a contract where 
States pay the Medicare beneficiary share of premium costs, and, in some 
instances, deductibles, and co-insurance. 
An exchange of eligibility information between Medicare and the SMA initiates 
Medicare premium payments. The service agreement between the SMA and 
business partner determines the intervals for this business process to execute. The 
business process receives eligibility information from Medicare, performs a matching 
process against the State Medicaid Enterprise member data store, generates buy-in 
files to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for verification, receives 
premium payment information from and generates payments to CMS.  
The SMA will pay the private health insurance premiums for members who have 
private health insurance benefits, if it determines the insurance to be cost effective. 
In these circumstances, the SMA prepares and sends a premium to the member’s 
private health insurance company.  
Health insurance premium payment initiates with an application for Medicaid where 
the applicant indicates they have third-party health coverage or by receiving eligibility 
information via referrals from Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) 
Offices, schools, community services organizations, or phone calls directly from 
members. The business process checks for internal eligibility status as well as 
eligibility with other payers, producing a report identifying individuals where paying 
premiums would be cost effective, and notifying members via Manage Applicant 
and Member Communication business process. 
 
NOTE: This business process does not include sending the premium payments as 
an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transaction. 
Trigger Event 
State transition Trigger Events:  
 
Receive alert of Medicare eligibility from Health Insurance Marketplace. 
 
Receive alert of Medicaid applicant with third-party insurance. 
Environment-based Trigger Events to include but not limited to: 
 
Periodic timetable is due for receipt of Medicare eligibility information. 
 
Periodic timetable (e.g., monthly) is due for insurance premium eligibility 
redetermination and payments.

The Manage Capitation Payment business process includes the activities to 
prepare Primary Care Case Management (PCCM) or Managed Care Organization 
(MCO) capitation payments. Some States offer members the option of enrolling in a 
PCCM product that requires the selection of a Primary Care Physician (PCP). The 
PCP receives a Per-Member-Per-Month (PMPM) capitation payment amount for all 
members that the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) assigns. The provider payment 
schedule defines the PCCM capitation rates typically actuary based on an age and 
gender rating or flat rate. Provider may opt in or out of PCCM plan and does not 
have to belong to the MCO. 
A prevailing alternative to the SMA integrated managed care model is to delegate 
specific member populations to MCOs and pay the MCO a PMPM capitation 
amount for all assigned members. The Manage Capitation Payment business 
process interrogates the member, provider, and MCO, member assignment and 
contract capitation information, and creates the information extract necessary to 
generate the capitation payment. The data extract includes any processing rules 
and options including retroactive adjustments to member assignments that affect 
the capitation payment amount to the provider or MCO. 
Trigger Event 
Environment-based Trigger Events to include but not limited to: 
 
Periodic (e.g., monthly) timetable to conduct capitation information extract. 
Result 
 
Alert sent to Manage Accounts Payable Information business process to 
generate Provider/MCO capitation payments. 
 
Tracking information as needed for measuring performance and business 
activity monitoring. 
Business 
Process Steps 
1. START: Timed event triggered on monthly basis to initiate Manage Capitation 
Payment business process to invoke capitation information extract. 
2. END: Send alert to Manage Accounts Payable Information business process 
to generate provider/MCO capitation payments.

Manage Fund 
FM Fiscal Management 
Manage Fund 
Item 
Details 
Description 
The Manage Fund business process oversees Medicaid funds, ensures accuracy in 
their allocation and the reporting of funding sources. Funding for Medicaid services 
may come from a variety of sources, and often, state funds span across state 
agency administrations, e.g., Mental Health, Aging, Substance Abuse, physical 
health, as well as state counties and local jurisdictions. The Manage Fund business 
process monitors funds through ongoing tracking and reporting of expenditures and 
corrects any improperly accounted expenditure. It also deals with projected and 
actual over and under fund allocations. 
 
Manage Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (FMAP) 
The Manage FMAP activity periodically reviews and modifies, as appropriate, FMAP 
and Enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (enhanced FMAP) rate 
used. (See 42 CFR 433.10). The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services 
(HHS) notifies the state of the FMAP and (enhanced FMAP) that HHS will use in 
determining the amount of federal matching for state medical assistance (Medicaid), 
Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) 
expenditures for a specified federal fiscal year. The State Medicaid Agency (SMA) 
reviews and approves the FMAP rates for application in enterprise accounting. 
 
Manage Federal Financial Participation (FFP) 
The Manage FFP business activity includes the creation and management of 
business rules for assigning claims, service payments, and recoveries (including 
RAC recoveries) to the appropriate FMAP, and the application of administrative 
costs to the state accounting system. It also includes the oversight of reporting and 
monitoring Advance Planning Documents or other program documents necessary to 
secure and maintain FFP. 
 
Draw and Report FFP 
The Draw and Report FFP business activity assures that the SMA properly draws 
federal funds and reports to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The 
SMA is responsible for assuring that the correct FFP rate applies to all expenditures 
in determining the amount of federal funds to draw. When CMS has approved a 
Medicaid State Plan, it makes quarterly grant awards to the SMA to cover the federal 
share of expenditures for services, training, and administration. The grant award 
authorizes the SMA to draw federal funds as needed in accordance with the Cash 
Management Improvement Act (CMIA) to pay the federal share of disbursements. 
The SMA receives FFP in expenditures for the CHIP program.
